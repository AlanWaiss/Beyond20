# Release Notes

v2.9.4 (June 5th 2024)
===

Hi everyone,

Yesterday, D&D Beyond updated their website slightly again, which broke rolling items and spells from the character sheet.
This small update fixes that as well as a couple of other small issues.

A special thank you for those who debugged the issue, contributed fixes to Beyond20 and helped with support. I love seeing the open-source spirit within our community.

Thank you as well to my generous [Patrons](https://patreon.com/kakaroto) and [Ko-fi/Github](/rations) supporters.

Enjoy!
